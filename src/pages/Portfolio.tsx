                    As VP of Product at Doona, I led the development of this revolutionary infant car seat that transforms into a stroller with the click of a button. This groundbreaking product required extensive engineering innovation to meet stringent safety standards while maintaining ease of use. I managed complex certification processes including ASTM F833 for stability, brakes, and safety features, plus ASTM F3317 crash testing. The project involved coordinating cross-functional teams through prototyping, design for manufacturing, pilot production, and scaling to mass production across global markets.

                    The Newton crib mattress represents a breakthrough in infant sleep safety through innovative breathable design. Unlike traditional mattresses, Newton's unique structure allows for unrestricted airflow, reducing the risk of CO2 rebreathing. I led the product development process from concept through manufacturing, focusing on creating a mattress that could be completely washable while maintaining structural integrity. The design required extensive material testing and safety validation to meet CPSC standards while delivering superior comfort and peace of mind for parents.

                    The Wim frozen yogurt machine revolutionizes commercial soft-serve production through advanced mixing technology and user-friendly design. I spearheaded the development of this sophisticated system that combines precision temperature control with innovative mixing mechanisms to deliver consistently perfect texture. The project required extensive food safety compliance, thermal engineering, and user interface design to create a machine that could operate reliably in high-volume commercial environments while maintaining product quality throughout extended operation cycles.
